I"<p>Ground Control to Major Tom<br />
Take your protein pills and put your helmet on<br />
Ground Control to Major Tom (ten, nine, eight, seven, six)<br />
Commencing countdown, engines on (five, four, three)<br />
Check ignition and may God’s love be with you (two, one, liftoff)</p>

<p>This is Ground Control to Major Tom<br />
You’ve really made the grade<br />
And the papers want to know whose shirts you wear<br />
Now it’s time to leave the capsule if you dare<br />
“This is Major Tom to Ground Control<br />
I’m stepping through the door<br />
And I’m floating in a most peculiar way<br />
And the stars look very different today<br />
For here<br />
Am I sitting in a tin can<br />
Far above the world<br />
Planet Earth is blue<br />
And there’s nothing I can do</p>
